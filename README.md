### Smart Farm IoT System - Project Report

#### 1. **Team Members and Individual Responsibility**
   - **Bunyasit Fang**: Data analytics and software development. Responsible for building the data collection platform, integrating AI/ML for predictive analysis, and developing user interfaces for monitoring farm conditions.
   - **Teetouch Satithamajit**: IoT system architecture and hardware integration. Responsible for sensor deployment, network setup, and ensuring connectivity of devices in the farm environment.

#### 2. **Project Name**
   - SmartFarm IoT System
     
#### 3. **Problem Statement**
   Traditional farming techniques face challenges like inefficient water usage, unpredictable weather conditions, pest infestations, and lack of real-time monitoring, which result in reduced crop yields and increased operational costs.

#### 4. **Possible Root Causes**
   - Lack of real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels.
   - Inefficient irrigation methods leading to water wastage.
   - Limited pest and disease monitoring systems.
   - Difficulty in predicting weather patterns and adjusting farming practices accordingly.

#### 5. **Proposed Solution**
   The SmartFarm IoT System aims to implement an IoT-based solution to monitor critical environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and pest activity. The system will include automated irrigation controls, pest detection, and AI-powered weather prediction, optimizing resource use and improving crop health.

#### 6. **IoT Technology Applied**
   - **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, and pest detection sensors.
   - **Connectivity**: Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) or cellular for long-range communication across farm areas.
   - **Automation**: IoT-based irrigation systems that automate watering based on real-time data.
   - **Data Processing**: Cloud-based data storage and AI/ML algorithms for analyzing patterns in farm conditions.

#### 7. **Expected Output**
   - Real-time monitoring of environmental factors.
   - Automated irrigation and pest control.
   - Predictive insights for crop health and weather adaptation.
   - User-friendly dashboard for farmers to monitor and control farm operations remotely.

#### 8. **Expected Outcome**
   - Optimized water and resource usage, reducing waste.
   - Increased crop yields due to better monitoring and timely interventions.
   - Early detection of pests and diseases, minimizing crop damage.
   - Better adaptation to weather conditions, leading to a more efficient farming cycle.

#### 9. **Budget Required**
  1000 Baht
